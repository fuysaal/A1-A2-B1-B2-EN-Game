This is a Python-based vocabulary training tool that features 902 essential English words categorized under the B1 level, which corresponds to an intermediate language proficiency according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).

The main goal of this program is to help users learn and remember English vocabulary at an intermediate level by using daily repetition. Each session shows a random word, encouraging learners to recall its meaning or look it up if they don't know it. If the user already knows the word, they can remove it from the list, allowing them to focus on the words they are still learning.

This tool was created not only to improve my English but also as a practical project to practice my Python programming skills. It involves basic file handling, randomization, user interaction, and console UI formatting. This makes it a valuable learning project for both coding and language improvement.

Whether used for daily vocabulary review or as a helpful language study companion, this program is a simple but effective way to build a solid understanding of English vocabulary at the B1 level.
