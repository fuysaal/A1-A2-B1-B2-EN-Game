This is a Python-based vocabulary training tool that features 1,077 essential English words categorized under the A1 level, which corresponds to beginner-level language proficiency according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).

The primary goal of this program is to help users internalize and retain basic English vocabulary through a simple and consistent repetition method. Each session presents a randomly selected word, encouraging learners to actively recall or research its meaning. If the user is already familiar with the word, they can choose to remove it from the listâ€”gradually narrowing the vocabulary set and focusing on unfamiliar items.

This tool was created not only as a means to improve my English but also as a practical exercise to apply and enhance my Python programming skills. It combines elements of basic file operations, randomization, user input handling, and console UI formatting, making it a helpful learning project from both a coding and a language perspective.

Whether used for daily vocabulary practice or as a lightweight language study companion, this program serves as a simple yet effective way to build a strong foundation in English vocabulary.
