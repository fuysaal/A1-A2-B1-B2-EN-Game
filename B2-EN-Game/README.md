This is a Python-based vocabulary training tool featuring 832 essential English words categorized under the B2 level, which aligns with an upper-intermediate language proficiency according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).

The primary aim of this program is to assist users in mastering and retaining English vocabulary at the B2 level through consistent daily repetition. Each session presents a randomly selected word, encouraging learners to recall its meaning, or to look it up if they are unfamiliar with it. If the user already knows the word, they can choose to remove it from the list, thereby narrowing down the vocabulary set to focus on the words that need more practice.

This tool was developed not only to enhance my English language skills but also as a practical project to refine my Python programming abilities. It combines essential techniques such as file management, randomization, user input handling, and formatting the console interface. This makes it a great project for both language learners and aspiring developers.

Whether used as part of a daily study routine or as an effective language-learning companion, this program offers a simple yet powerful way to build and reinforce a strong foundation in English vocabulary at the B2 level.
